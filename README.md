C/C++ Audio Mixer code

This is my take on mixing audio. This code is horrible and should not be used by anyone, but if your looking for a starting point for mixing audio take a look. 
NOTES:

Currently WAV and OGG supported
Currently all samples must be the same frequency. 
Code currently does not adjust the sample volume.
Code currently is MONO ONLY
