C/C++ Audio Mixer code

This is my take on mixing audio. This code is horrible and should not be used by anyone, but if your looking for a starting point for mixing audio take a look. 

NOTES:

- Currently WAV and OGG supported. MP3 support coming.
- Currently can only adjust the frequency on MONO sample. 
- Code currently does not adjust the sample volume.
- Code currently is MONO ONLY

License Unlicense, use however you want.
